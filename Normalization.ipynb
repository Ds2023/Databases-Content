        "Normalization is a process in database design used to minimize redundancy and dependency by organizing fields and table of a database. The main goal of normalization is to separate data into logical units, ensuring that each piece of data is stored only once and in the most appropriate place.\n",
        "\n",
        "Normalization involves several steps, each building on the previous one, and each step is known as a \"normal form\". The most commonly used normal forms are the First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF), and Third Normal Form (3NF). Higher normal forms, such as Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) and Fourth Normal Form (4NF), exist but are less commonly used in practical applications."
