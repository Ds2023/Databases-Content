        "\n",
        "**1. Relational Databases**\n",
        "\n",
        "Relational databases are structured around the relational model, which organizes data into tables consisting of rows and columns. Each table represents an entity, and relationships between entities are established using keys. Relational databases are widely used in applications where data integrity, flexibility, and scalability are paramount. Examples of relational database management systems (RDBMS) include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle Database.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. NoSQL Databases**\n",
        "\n",
        "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are designed to handle unstructured and semi-structured data. Unlike relational databases, NoSQL databases do not require a fixed schema, allowing for more flexibility in data modeling. NoSQL databases are commonly used in big data and real-time web applications, where scalability and performance are critical. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Couchbase.\n",

        "**3. Object-Oriented Databases**\n",
        "\n",
        "Object-oriented databases store data in the form of objects, which encapsulate both data and behavior. They are well-suited for applications with complex data structures and inheritance relationships. Object-oriented databases blur the lines between programming languages and databases, enabling seamless integration between the two. Examples of object-oriented databases include db4o and ObjectDB.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Graph Databases**\n",
        "\n",
        "Graph databases are designed to represent and query interconnected data using graph structures. They excel at handling complex relationships and are particularly useful for applications such as social networks, recommendation systems, and network analysis. Graph databases use nodes to represent entities and edges to represent relationships between entities. Examples of graph databases include Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, and ArangoDB.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Document Databases**\n",
        "\n",
        "Document databases store data in flexible, semi-structured documents such as JSON or XML. They are well-suited for applications with constantly changing data schemas or where hierarchical data structures are prevalent. Document databases provide high performance and scalability, making them popular choices for content management systems, e-commerce platforms, and mobile applications. Examples of document databases include MongoDB, Couchbase, and Firebase Firestore."
